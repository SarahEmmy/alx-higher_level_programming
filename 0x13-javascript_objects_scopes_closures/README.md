## Exercise 1: Creating Objects

**Objective:** Learn how to create objects in JavaScript using object literals and constructors.

**Description:** In this exercise, you'll practice creating objects in JavaScript. You will create objects using both object literals and constructor functions.

## Exercise 2: Object Properties

**Objective:** Understand how to work with object properties, including adding, updating, and deleting properties.

**Description:** In this exercise, you'll work with object properties. You will practice adding new properties to objects, updating existing properties, and deleting properties from objects.

## Exercise 3: Object Methods

**Objective:** Learn how to define methods inside JavaScript objects.

**Description:** In this exercise, you'll dive into object methods. You will create objects with methods and learn how to call those methods to perform various tasks.

## Exercise 4: Scopes

**Objective:** Understand JavaScript variable scope, including global scope and local scope.

**Description:** In this exercise, you'll explore variable scope in JavaScript. You will work with global and local variables, and you'll learn about the difference between them.

## Exercise 5: Closures

**Objective:** Learn about closures in JavaScript and how they allow functions to "remember" variables from their parent scopes.

**Description:** In this exercise, you'll explore closures in JavaScript. You will create functions that capture variables from their outer scopes and learn how closures can be used to maintain state and encapsulate data.
