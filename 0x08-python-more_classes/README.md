## Description of Each Task ‚úçÔ∏è

### 0. Simple rectangle
Write an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.

### 1. Real definition of a rectangle
Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by adding private instance attributes `width` and `height`.

### 2. Area and Perimeter
Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with additional methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

### 3. String representation
Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with an additional method to print the rectangle with the `#` character.

### 4. Eval is magic
Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with an additional method to get a string representation of the rectangle that can be used with the `eval()` function.

### 5. Detect instance deletion
Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with an additional method to print a message when an instance of `Rectangle` is deleted.

### 6. How many instances
Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with a class attribute `number_of_instances` to keep track of the number of instances created.

### 7. Change representation
Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with additional methods to change the representation of the rectangle.

### 8. Compare rectangles
Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with additional methods to compare rectangles based on their areas and perimeters.

### 9. A square is a rectangle
Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with additional methods to handle squares, which are a special type of rectangle.

### 10. Class and instance attributes
Write a blog post describing how object and class attributes work in Python.
