## Learning Objectives ðŸ’¡
What you should learn from this project:

- Understand why Python programming is awesome
- Learn about superclass, baseclass, or parentclass
- Understand what a subclass is
- Know how to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- Understand when an instance can have new attributes
- Learn how to inherit a class from another
- Know how to define a class with multiple base classes
- Understand the default class every class inherits from
- Learn how to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Understand which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
- Understand the purpose of inheritance
- Know how to use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super` built-in functions

## Description of the Tasks

### 0. Lookup
Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object.

### 1. My list
Write a class `MyList` that inherits from `list`.

### 2. Exact same object
Write a function that returns `True` if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class; otherwise `False`.

### 3. Same class or inherit from
Write a function that returns `True` if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class; otherwise `False`.

### 4. Only sub class of
Write a function that returns `True` if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class; otherwise `False`.

### 5. Geometry module
Write an empty class `BaseGeometry`.

### 6. Improve Geometry
Write a class `BaseGeometry` (based on `5-base_geometry.py`).

### 7. Integer validator
Write a class `BaseGeometry` (based on `6-base_geometry.py`).

### 8. Rectangle
Write a class `Rectangle` that inherits from `BaseGeometry` (`7-base_geometry.py`).

### 9. Full rectangle
Write a class `Rectangle` that inherits from `BaseGeometry` (`7-base_geometry.py`). (task based on `8-rectangle.py`)

### 10. Square #1
Write a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` (`9-rectangle.py`).

### 11. Square #2
Write a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` (`9-rectangle.py`). (task based on `10-square.py`).
